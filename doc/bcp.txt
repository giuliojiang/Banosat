BCP

    Use an assignment history tracker
    ArrayMap<unsigned, assignment_t> assignment_history
    
    Where an assignment_t is a signed integer where:
    - its absolute value is the variable being assigned
    - its sign is the current assignment.
    
    The key of the map is the level of the assignment (starting at level 0)

    Suppose we start with formula
    
    (p v q) (q v z)
    unsatisfied clauses: 0, 1
    
    - 1 -
    
    assign p = T (from decision step)
    
    (p v q) (q v z)
     T
    unsatisfied clauses: 0, 1
    
    - 2 -
    
    Check if formula is satisfied or has conflicts
    
    - 3 -
    
    Run BCP algorithm.
    
    Scan through the unsatisfied clauses for clauses with 1 unassigned variable.
    (future optimization: watch literals)
    
    Every time we find a clause with 1 unassigned variable, make an assignment
    if the literal is
        p  -> T
        Â¬p -> F
        
    Loop until BCP cannot find any clauses with 1 unassigned variable anymore
    
CHOOSING A NEW ASSIGNMENT (DETERMINISTIC WAY)

    Deterministic convention: for each variable, first assign T, then F.

    For the first assignment of the run, choose the first available variable from the variable map.
    
    Assign it to T.
    
    Now suppose we backtrack to level N.
    So all levels >N are un-assigned, and level N is the one we need to re-assign.
    
    If variable at N was assigned T -> assign F.
    If N==0 and variable at 0 was assigned F -> formula is UNSAT.
    If variable at N was assigned F -> backtrack to level N-1.
    
UNASSIGN AND BACKTRACK

    backtrack_to_level(context, level):
        
        for i [current_level, level - 1]:
            unassign_variable_at_level(context, i)
        
        choose_new_assignment(context, level)
